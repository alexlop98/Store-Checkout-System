# Store-Checkout-System
The application provides fast lookup for product information. A clerk (or customer) inputs a product stock number and the system returns the record for that item. The system is designed to provide facilities to add, remove and look up items, along with certain other utility functions.
The project will use the DictionaryADT interface (provided) to support your application program. The dictionary takes key-value pairs.
